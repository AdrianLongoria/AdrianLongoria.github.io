        <h1>Video Games</h1>
        <p>I have many hobbies, but some of my favorite things to do are playing video games.</p>

        <p>I've played multiple differnt types of video games from fps to mmo and moba. Also, I've on many different platforms such as pc, console, and mobile.
            <br> Some of the main video games that I play now are League of Legends, Fortnite, Overwach (not as much), and Yu-Gi Oh! Duel Links on mobile.</p>

        <h1>Places I've been</h1>
        <p>I have been to many different states in the US, sometimes to visit family and other times to just vacation and see new places. Some of the states that I
            <br> have been to are Nevada, Arizona, Colorado, Texas (mostly to visit family), Arkansas, South Carolina, and Hawaii.</p>

        <p>My favorite place I visited was probally Hawaii. The island I went to was Maui, and while there my family and I did a bunch of cool things there.
            <br> We hiked to see some waterfalls, and went to a black sand beach. Also, my family and I went whale watching and also when we went
            <br> out we went to a spot called Molokini crater to go snorkeling and saw all types of colorful fish and a couple sea turtles which was cool. </p>
